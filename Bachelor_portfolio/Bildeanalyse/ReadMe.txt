The whole project was done in google collab.

Project_blur.ipynb, Project_Color.ipynb and Project_gray.ipynb is the files that where used to make use of the yolov5 object detection algorithm.
They are basically the same file, just needed to use them all at the same time so the training would go faster. 
They all have comments on how to achieve the results i had.

Blur.py was used to convert the colored dataset into a blurred version.
