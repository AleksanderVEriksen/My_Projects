Upload both Digit_test.zip and Digit.training.zip to the google collab session when you open the file SVM.ipynb.

- This is done by dragging them both to the section files(click on the folder icon) on the left. 
- Wait for them both to upload
- Then run all code from top to bottom.



- note: 
the accuracy.txt and accuracy_pca.txt are just for reference for what i got.
